# Global and common settings for installing Istio.

# This file is configured for a small scale production cluster.
# Use user-values-medium or custom settings to tune up the CPU and scalling.
# Additional values overrides can be used.

# Each individual component will use values from this file, with defaults and 'advanced' settings included in
# its own chart's values.yaml.

# TODO: trim this file to commonly used settings, leave 'advanced' in the individual values.yaml (they can
# still be overridden by users, but won't show in basic documentation.

# This doesn't match istio defaults, which are more geared towards tests and bookinfo.
